Application Resilience Testing

Stampede targets the processes of a given application and
will randomly kill processes that belong to it, with a
definable intensity.

Fine-grained control over what to really kill can be achieved
with user-defined callbacks.

== Example

[source,erlang]
----
%% Start the stampede application
ok=application:start(stampede).

%% The target application must be running
{ok, _}=application:ensure_all_started(my_app).

%% Start stampede
{ok, _}=stampede:start_herd(my_app).

%% ... Wait and see what happens ...

%% Stop stampede
ok=stampede:stop_herd(my_app).
----
