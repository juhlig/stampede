Application Resilience Testing

Stampede targets and randomly kills the processes and ports belonging
to a given application or supervisor, with a definable intensity.

Fine-grained control over what to really kill can be achieved
with user-defined callbacks.

== Example

[source,erlang]
----
%% Start the stampede application
ok=application:start(stampede).

%% The target application must be running
{ok, _}=application:ensure_all_started(my_app).

%% Start stampede
{ok, _}=stampede:start_herd(my_stampede, {application, my_app}).

%% Activate stampede
ok=stampede:activate(my_stampede).

%% ... Wait and see what happens ...

%% Stop stampede
ok=stampede:stop_herd(my_stampede).
