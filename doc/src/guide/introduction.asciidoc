== Introduction

Stampede is an application resilience testing tool.

It will kill random processes of the targeted applications. Fine-grained
control over what really may and may not be killed can be achieved with
user-defined callbacks.

=== Limitations

* Only individual applications can be targeted, not an entire Erlang system.
* Only "real" applications can be targeted, not library applications.
* Only local applications can be targeted, ie applications whose top supervisor
  runs on the same node as stampede.
* Only processes are targeted, not ports, as their relation to an
  application is uncertain.
* Only local processes are targeted, even if they are started by
  a local application but on another node.

=== Environment

Stampede was developed and tested for Erlang/OTP 18+.
