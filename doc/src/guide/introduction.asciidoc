== Introduction

Stampede is an application resilience testing tool.

It will kill random processes and ports of the targeted supervisor of application.
Fine-grained control over what really may and may not be killed can be achieved with
user-defined callbacks.

=== Limitations

* Only individual applications or supervisors can be targeted, not an entire Erlang system.
* Only "real" applications can be targeted, not library applications.
* Only local applications and supervisors can be targeted, ie running on the same node
  as stampede does.
* Only local processes or ports are targeted, even if they are started by
  a local application or supervisor, but on another node.
* An application or supervisor can not be targeted by multiple stampedes at
  once.
* `stampede` may not play well with other tracers, because a process or port can only
  be traced by one tracer.

=== Environment

Stampede was developed and tested for Erlang/OTP 18+.
