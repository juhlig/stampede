== Introduction

Stampede is an application resilience testing tool.

It will kill random processes of the targeted supervisor of application.
Fine-grained control over what really may and may not be killed can be
achieved with user-defined callbacks.

=== Limitations

* Only individual applications or supervisors can be targeted, not an entire Erlang system.
* Only "real" applications can be targeted, not library applications.
* Only local applications and supervisors can be targeted, ie running on the same node
  as stampede does.
* Only processes are targeted, not ports, as their relation to an application or supervisor
  is uncertain.
* Only local processes are targeted, even if they are started by
  a local application or supervisor, but on another node.

=== Environment

Stampede was developed and tested for Erlang/OTP 18+.
