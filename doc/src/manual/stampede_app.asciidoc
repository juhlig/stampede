== Name

stampede - Application Resilience Testing

== Description

Stampede is a resilience testing tool for Erlang applications.

When started, stampede will start tracing the target application
in order to keep track of the processes belonging to it,
and randomly kill those processes with a definable intensity.

Fine-grained control over what to really kill and what not can
be achieved with user-defined callbacks.
